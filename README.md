## Abstract

This project is a visualization of various languages and where they are spoken in the United States. The goal of our visualization is to provide a tool for users to gain a better understanding of the diversity in the US through the unique medium of language, which doesn’t get discussed as often compared to race or nationality. We use data from the US census bureau compiled by the American Community survey to showcase the number of speakers by metropolitan areas, counties, and states. In order to assess the effectiveness of our visualization in highlighting diversity, we ask three participants about the most populous ancestries in the US before and after using our visualization to determine whether our visual had any effect in the correctness of their answers. What we found was that our visual did help users in correctly identifying ancestries as well as gaining a better understanding about diversity in the US.

## Local Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
Installs all dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
